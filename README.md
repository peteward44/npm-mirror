# npm-mirror
Inputs a npm-shrinkwrap.json and downloads and replaces all "resolved" fields to a http server of your choosing. This allows you to download &amp; cache all npm modules onto your own server - meaning if a package is unpublished from npm's registry you can still install your own hosted copy and your application is not held to the whims of strangers.
